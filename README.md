## Getting Started

[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, MobileWright, and all major frameworks.

With TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can run [MobileWright](https://mobilewright.dev) tests on the device cloud using the [`@testmuai/mobilewright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testmuai/mobilewright) driver. This sample shows how to run a MobileWright test on TestMu AI, using the Proverbial sample app.
